# Potential Additions
1. Add form errors to address empty/invalid fields
2. Ability to use media other than text in blog posts (pics, videos, emoji, etc)
3. Caching to prevent potential slow response times (maybe especially useful if 2 implemented)
4. User sign-in and auth levels (Admin, Author, Reader, etc.)
5. Profile view for accounts created
