# Potential Additions
1. Ability to Comment on Blog Posts, as well as view comments from others
2. Ability to use media other than text in blog posts (pics, videos, emoji, etc)
3. Caching to prevent potential slow response times (maybe especially useful if 2 implemented)
4. User sign-in and auth levels (Admin, Author, Reader, etc.)
5. Profile view for accounts created
